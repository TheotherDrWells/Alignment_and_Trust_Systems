## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository anchors a growing ecosystem of tools, theories, and diagnostics for **alignment**, **memory continuity**, and **runtime integrity** in adaptive systems. Each linked project contributes a foundational layer to building AI that is structurally stable, memory-aware, and behaviorally trustworthy.

## ðŸ”— Core Components

### ðŸ”„ [Zone of Maximal Transformation (ZMT)](https://github.com/TheotherDrWells/ZMT)
A theoretical framework identifying the structural region where learning is maximized, feedback is metabolized, and prediction errors are bounded but meaningful. ZMT underlies adaptive system behavior at the edge of chaos and determinism.

### ðŸ©º [AI Nurse](https://github.com/TheotherDrWells/AI_Nurse)
A lightweight runtime companion for large language models (LLMs). It monitors outputs for topic drift, hallucination, and instability, triggering **tiered interventions** and offering **diagnostic flags** in real time.

### ðŸ§  [Reclaiming Memory](https://github.com/TheotherDrWells/Reclaiming-Memory)
A proposal for **local-first, user-owned memory architecture** in AI systems. It envisions encrypted, persistent, and portable memory that restores user autonomy, enabling continuity across sessions and providers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Together, these systems aim to:

- Monitor inference-time integrity in AI outputs  
- Define and preserve structural alignment  
- Support user trust through memory continuity  
- Build post-latent, deterministic diagnostic layers
